## My process
- I made the basic html structure which involved a container with two sections for left and right side of the design.
- I gave Ids and classes to html elements wherever necessary for further styling.
- I styled each element using internal CSS by targeting various elements,classes and Ids using CSS selectors.
- I used flexbox ,grid and position property for the layout designing.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned a lot during this project. Some of my major learnings:

- learned the difference in usage of flexbox and css grid.
- using 'fr' unit for equal division of grid
   The code is- grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
- knowing difference in usage of <span> and <p> tag
- learnt about setting gradient background
  The code is- background: linear-gradient(to bottom, #9608f4, #0800ff);
- learnt how to use Shadow effect in css
  The code is- box-shadow: 6px 6px 7px rgba(139, 148, 231, 0.4);
   

### Continued development
I will continue working on more HTML CSS and JS based projects strengthning my frontend development skills.
